    <ul>
    <li>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</li>
      <p>I scanned all the techniques and I studied more deeply those that interested me.
      </p>
    <li>What did you find interesting?</li>
      <p>
      <ul>
      <li>The Power of Meditation - this is something I have heard a little of before, but it was nice to read a fuller explanation especially the scientific explanation of what is happening.</li>
      <li>The Pomodoro Technique - I had also dabbled with doing something like this, but once again was good to see it given a bit more structure.</li>
      <li>Make It Big By Starting Small - I've often found that starting a new project or task can be intimidating if one thinks that it has to be big from the start. This often leads to paralysis and inaction.</li>
      <li>Create a Habit; Tiny Habits; Fogg Method  - these three all share the central idea that "Action leads belief". I found it very interesting that this is what the scientific evidence shows.</li>
      <li>Counter-intuitive Productivity - this was an interesting read but I'm not yet sure which of these I'll pursue.</li>
      <li>Tricks For Getting Into The Zone - most of this is new to me, so I'm still evaluating this.</li>
      <li>Timebox - new jargon for somthing that I already had experienced.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

    <li>What worked for you?</li>
      <p>Most of the above seem to have some merit.</p>
    <li>Which will you experiment further with?</li>
      <p>As above! But especially the Pomodoro Method.</p>
    </ul>
