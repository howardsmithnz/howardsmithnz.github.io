          <h3>Cultural Blog - Motivation</h3>
            <h5>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h5>
              <p>Sounds like fun! Seriously though, this was an interesting insight. The idea that our normal behaviour is to pursue the least valuble of these was quite a revalation. Of course the real trick is to reprogramme oneself to invert these priorities.</p>
            <h5>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, What are your core values?</h5>
              <p>It's very hard for me to instantly write down some words which will stand the test of time here. So for now here is my interim answer: My core values are honesty, integrity, fairness, friendship, and a sense of humour.</p>
            <h5>What do you stand for?</h5>
              <p>As above...but here goes...I stand for the idea that we should try to leave this place no worse than we found it! Balance your rights with your obligations, try to help those who need a little help, do your best to generally improve things. Of course it's easier said than done but that's the general idea!</p>
            <h5>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h5>
              <p>This also sounds generally good but I find it pretty hard to instantly recall a relevant episode from my life to use as an example to meditate on. Often I seem to recall such an episode days or weeks later! This means that is will take quite a while to fully test out this procedure.</p>
            <h5>Any other musings?</h5>
              <p>I like the fact that they frequently refer to a scientific basis for their claims. I would otherwise be inclined to dismiss some of this stuff as "feel good quackery"! However it's also important to remember that different people will draw different conclusions from the same piece of research especially if the design of the experiment allows for some ambiguity.</p>
