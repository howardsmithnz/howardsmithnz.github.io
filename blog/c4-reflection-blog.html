     So here's what I thought...

    <p>
     - What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience?
    <p>It seems like it fills a valuable niche, and enables a wide variety of people to bring their other (i.e. non-tech)skills to the tech industry.
    </p>

     - What are your impressions?
     <p>Relief basically. This is pretty much the way I like to work. If we see something broken, then let's fix it! I also think that my best work has often been done in a group situation. (BTW, I like kitchens!)
     </p>

     - How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
     <p>Easily. It's the kind that's most natural for me. I've spent a lot of time in places with the opposite style and found that it is not a way I am suited to.
     </p>


     - Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?
     <p>No. I already did a lot of research about DBC/EDA and it just further confirms a lot of what I already thought.
     </p>

    - Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
    <p>Right now I'm both excited and nervous! I can't wait to develop new tech skills, relationships, social skills, etc. But can I do it? (OMG..panic..panic...!)
