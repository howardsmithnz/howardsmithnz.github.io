        <h2>The tasks:</h2>
        <section>
          <em>What is grid based design?</em>
          <p>
            This is a design system where every element is positioned with regard to a grid. It was initially developed in the printing industry, but is now also applied to web page design.
            If the size of the grid changes the elements should also change by keeping their position relative to the grid.

          <em>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</em>
          <p>
            These days web pages are viewed on many different devices: desktop PCs, laptops, tablets, and smart phones. These have different screen sizes. Responsive web design is the idea that you develop pages that can automatically resize themselves to fit different screen sizes while maintaining basic usabilty. Twitter Bootstrap is a currently popular framework to achieve this.

          <em>Semantic structure</em>
          <p>
            Tags such as header, main, footer, h1, h2, article, aside, section, and nav, convey information about what is the role of tagged data in the web page. They assist with tasks like merging documents and with assitive technologies like screen readers.

          <em>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on</em>
          <p>
            I found the visual teaching style of Udacity very easy to understand. After watching the videos I could better understand the documentation.
