          <h3>Technical Blog - Sprint 9</h3>
            <h5>Which concepts did you find most difficult?</h5>
              <p>Functional programming in JavaScript - I can do the basics of this in Python and Haskell, but the syntax of JavaScript, and the explanations given in the documentation, make it seem harder to follow what's going on.</p>
              <p>CSS Layout and Floats - I found it hard to understand what effect on presentation the Float properties would have. Where various elements would finally display seemed a little random to me.</p>
            <h5>Which skills/concepts do you feel still confused by?</h5>
              <p>Both of the above. I actually found that by reviewing what I knew about functional programming in Python and Haskell made the topic easier. JavaScript's version of some of the functions (e.g. reduce) seems a little awkward to me. CSS Layout is still a weak point for me. Also the fact that sometimes JavaScript let's you do something ridiculous without producing an error message is a source of great worry! </p>
            <h5>Which skills/concepts do you feel you understand best?</h5>
              <p>I feel comfortable with the basic aspects of HTML although using it well will only come through much practice. The general approach to programming is also something that I feel OK about.</p>
            <h5>Which aspects of web development so far do you enjoy the most?</h5>
              <p>jQuery was a little hard to get going at first, but now it seeems much easier - and it's fun! Also implementing little tips to improve the look of a website (such as using a cool looking web font) are "instant reward" moments.</p>
