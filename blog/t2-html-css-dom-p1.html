        <h2>The task:</h2>
          <p>
          <i>"From the websites you visited in the practice assignment, create a list of design and structural features you liked that you may want to use in your designs next week. Think of this as a wishlist.

          Use appropriate HTML structure (e.g. sections / headers / lists / divs / paragraphs) and answer the following" </i>
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, looking through a number of websites left me very confused at first. There were so many different styles, features, and a great deal of visual content which seemed to require a high level of artistic talent to acheive. The more I looked, the more despondent I became! However after a bit of time for reflection I realized that the most  important thing for me was to simplify the whole thing. So my basic design guidelines now are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Simplicity</li>
            <li>Clean, clear, cool design</li>
            <li>No clutter</li>
            <li>No gimmicks</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To this end, I want:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A simple 3 or 4 colour scheme</li>
            <li>An easy to read background for text</li>
            <li>A good simple neat navbar</li>
            <li>Some nice but subtle shadows around some elements</li>
            <li>A simple background or header image</li>
            <li>A design that resizes nicely</li>
          </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>More questions</h2>
          <p>
          <i>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</i>    
          </p>
          <p>OK, this is not an original analogy but here goes...The HTML is like the structure of a building. So foundations, walls, roof, doors, beams, columns, floorboards, cladding, and suchlike could all be compared to HTML elements. Some elements (e.g. room) can contain other elements (e.g. floorboards). CSS is like the paint, wallpaper, carpets, curtains, and so on that give a place its style. They can all be changed relatively easily to give a different look and feel. The DOM is like a diagram of how the elements fit together.</p>
          <p>
          <i>What is meant by boxifying design?</i>    
          </p> 
          <p>This is simply the process of taking an existing graphical page design and dividing it visually into a number of boxes. These boxes may then be divided into a number of further (and smaller) boxes. These boxes may be represented in the HTML by tags such as div.
          </p>
          <p>
          <i>What is the box model?</i>    
          </p>
          <p>In HTML everything is boxes. That is, every element in HTML renders on the page in a box of some kind. This includes shapes such as circles and the like(although the box may not be visible). So the page layout may be thought of as simply a collection of boxes.</p>
