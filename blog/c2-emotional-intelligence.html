        <em>Did you connect with any of the analogies for the mind?</em>
        <p>Surprisingly I found these analogies quite easy to grasp and easy to understand. The first analogy was a visual one showing two versions of an image - one was grainy and smudgy, the other was clear and fine-grained. This very clearly showed the meanings of resolution and vividness. The next analogy of a flag as the mind and a flagpole as mindfulness was also an easy one to recall. Finally the idea of letting thoughts or emotions pass as if "being written on water" is a simple but beautiful way to put it.</p>
        <em>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</em>
        Well the three main points of: Emotional awareness; Accurate self-assessment; and Self-confidence. The follow sections  elaborated on possible ways to acheive the first, to develop the second, and finally result in the third. I think the basic idea of using "I feel" instead of "I am" is a very useful shorthand way to really start modifying ones behaviour. I am a little sceptical on how one can know if one's self assessments are accurate or just delusions!
        <em>How did you find the body scanning?</em>
        Not easy. It's hard to retain a meditative state while trying to go through a checklist! (At least that's what it felt like!) This must take quite a while to achieve, and it may be hard to learn just from a book alone.
